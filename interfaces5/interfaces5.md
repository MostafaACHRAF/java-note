## Interfaces

- Interface's constants are implicitly "public final static".<br/>
- Interface's constants must be initialized, or a compilition error is thrown.<br/>
- Interface's methods are implicitly public.<br/>
- The classes implementing interface's abstract methods can't assign weaker access to those methods, thus the implemented methods must be public.<br/> 
- Interfac's can't define constructors like classes do.<br/>
- We can define a reference variable of type interface, but this reference variable must refer to an object of a class that implements that interface.<br/>.
- Reference variable of type interface can't access all attributes of an interface.<br/>
