## This keyword

- The this keyword is an implicit reference variable, initialized by the JVM for each object.<br/>
- We can use 'this' keyword to access variables and methods and constructors of objects.<br/>
- The 'this' keyword always points to an object's own instance.<br/>
- The use of 'this' keyword is optional, Except when an instance variable has the same name as local variable or method parameter.<br/>
- We can use 'this' keyword to call an object's constructor, in that case the use of 'this' must be in the first line within a constructor.<br/>
- We can use 'this' keyword in an interface's default method to access constants and methods of that interface (since java8).<br/>
