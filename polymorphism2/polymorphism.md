## Polymorphism with interfaces

- Polymorphism can also be implemented using interfaces.<br/>
- Polymorphism with classes require a derived class to override base class's methods. While polymorphism with interfaces require a class to implement interface's abstract and default methods.<br/>
- Interface's static methods cannot participate in polymorphism.<br/>
- Visible methods to a reference variable are decided at compile time based on reference variable's type.<br/>
- The method to execute is decided at runtime by the JVM using referenced object's type.<br/>
