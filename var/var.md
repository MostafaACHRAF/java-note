- You can reference an non static interface in a static context.
- var is not a reserved keyword, its a reserved type name, thus you can name your variables 'var' without compilation errors.
- You can't use 'var' to create class fields and method parameters and arrays initialization.
- You can't declare a 'var' without providing enough context, for example: (var i;) is not allowed. The compiler can't infer the type!
- The compiler infers the type of the reference variable from the initialized on the right side: var i = 9;
- You can't initialize a var with null
- You can't use var as a method return type, or method parameter
- You can't use var in compound declaration: var i, j = 0;
