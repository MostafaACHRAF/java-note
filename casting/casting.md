## Casting

- Casting means forcing a reference varibale to be of another type.<br/>
- If a classe inherits another class or implements an interface, then their variables can be cast to each other's type.<br/>
- You can't assign an object of type super class to a reference variable of type derived class. If you do, you will get a compilation error!<br/>
- You can cast an object of type super class into derived class type to prevent the above compilation error, but you will get a runtime error 'classCastException'.<br/>
